# RowBinaryFiles.jl

Frustrated with the size and speed of CSV files, as well as the loss of precision when parsing strings, the goal of this project is to implement a basic binary file format that can accomodate tabular data streams.

Inspired by BSON.jl and various implementations of BufferedStreams.jl.
